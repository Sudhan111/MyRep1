  This is used by 'iiq upgrade' to drive upgrading the schema and data between revisions.
  There are two files that define the upgrade: upgrade.xml and upgradeObjects.xml.
  upgrade.xml file is processed in a special way before Hibernate is started so that changes can be made at the JDBC
  level. This file should only contain <ImportAction> elements that use the "execute" command to call upgrader classes.
  *DO NOT PUT STATIC XML OBJECTS IN UPGRADE.XML*
  upgradeObjects.xml is included by upgrade.xml; it will be imported after Hibernate is started. Any changes to objects
  that can be represented as static XML or as ImportActions with the "merge" command must go in these files to ensure
  that they are parsed after Hibernate has been started so that references can be resolved. Like upgrade.xml, each
  action should have a revision attribute specified, which will be checked while upgrading to make sure that upgrades
  aren't run multiple times. First the upgraders that are marked as pre-Hibernate are run, then Hibernate is started,
  then the ones marked as post-Hibernate are run. After all the upgraders are run and Hibernate is started, the
  upgradeObjects.xml file is imported. In some special cases we have upgraders that run after the upgradeObjects.xml
  import.
